MNKDraggableDroppable provides a drag and drop API for iOS.

A draggable view can be moved with user interaction. A droppable view provides an area in which a draggable view can be dropped. MNKDraggableDroppable allows you to identify a view as a draggable or droppable, and provides a mechanism for responding to events involving the two.

MNKDraggableDroppable was created for the make-offer interaction in maneki for iOS.

## Installation

Install with [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

`pod 'MNKDraggableDroppable', :head`

*I'm still writing this component so a complete pod hasn't yet been released since the code is subject to change. For now you can install using the `:head` symbol should you want to.*
